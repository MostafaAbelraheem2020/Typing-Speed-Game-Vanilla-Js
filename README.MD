## Features

- Difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard, each with a different time limit per word.[1]
- Countdown timer showing the remaining time to type the current word.[1]

- Simple UI that runs entirely in the browser with no backend.[1]

## How to Play

1. Choose a difficulty level from the list (Easy / Normal / Hard).[1]
2. Click the Start Playing button to start the game.[1]
3. A random word will appear; type it in the input field before the time runs out.[1]
4. If you type the word correctly within the time limit, your score increases and a new word appears.[1]
5. If the time ends before typing the word correctly, the attempt ends and you can start again.[1]

## Technologies Used

- HTML to structure the page and display the game elements.[1]
- CSS to style the user interface and layout.[1]
- JavaScript to handle the game logic (levels, timer, word selection, scoring).[1]

2. Open the main.html file directly in your browser, or use a live server (such as the VS Code Live Server extension).[1]
3. Start playing from the main page.[1]
